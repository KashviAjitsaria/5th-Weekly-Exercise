## Put your homework on GitHub!

Go [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md) or to previous homework to remind yourself how to get set up. 

Once your repository is created, you should always open your **project** rather than just opening an .Rmd file. You can do that by either clicking on the .Rproj file in your repository folder on your computer. Or, by going to the upper right hand corner in R Studio and clicking the arrow next to where it says Project: (None). You should see your project come up in that list if you've used it recently. You could also go to File --> Open Project and navigate to your .Rproj file. 

## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* **NEW!!** With animated graphs, add `eval=FALSE` to the code chunk that creates the animation and saves it using `anim_save()`. Add another code chunk to reread the gif back into the file. See the [tutorial](https://animation-and-interactivity-in-r.netlify.app/) for help. 

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.

## Warm-up exercises from tutorial

  1. Choose 2 graphs you have created for ANY assignment in this class and add interactivity using the `ggplotly()` function.
 
Gendered African American Firsts from Tidy Tuesday:
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gender_decades <-
  firsts %>% 
    mutate(decade = year - year %% 10) %>%  #adds a variable for the decade in which the achievement happened
    mutate(value = 1) %>%  #adds a variable indicating one incidence of achievement
    select(decade, gender, value) 

gender_decades %>% 
  group_by(decade, gender) %>% 
  summarize(tot_value = sum(value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = tot_value, x = decade, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(title = "Gender Difference in African American Firsts Since the 1730s",
       y = "Number of Firsts", x = "Decade") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  transition_states(gender)
anim_save("AAfirsts.gif")
```
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("AAfirsts.gif")
```

Gendered Himalayan Expedition Roles:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
top_positions <- members %>% 
  group_by(expedition_role) %>% 
  summarise(position_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(position_count)) %>% 
  head(n = 10) 

top_positions %>% 
  left_join(members,
            by = c("expedition_role")) %>% 
  select(expedition_role, position_count, sex) %>% 
  group_by(expedition_role, sex) %>% 
  mutate(sex_count = n()) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = expedition_role, 
             x = sex_count, fill = sex)) +
  geom_col(stat = "identity", 
           position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(title = "Sex Difference in Himalayan Expedition Roles", 
       y = "Expedition Role", 
       x = "Count",
       subtitle = "For Top 10 Most Common Expedition Roles",
       caption = "By Kashvi Ajitsaria") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 15)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5)) +
  transition_states(sex)
anim_save("ExpeditionRoles.gif")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ExpeditionRoles.gif")
``` 
 
 
 2. Use animation to tell an interesting story with the `small_trains` dataset that contains data from the SNCF (National Society of French Railways). These are Tidy Tuesday data! Read more about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-26).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
small_trains %>% 
  select(year, departure_station, arrival_station, journey_time_avg) %>% 
  filter(departure_station == "GENEVE") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = journey_time_avg)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "Blue") +
  transition_states(year) +
  labs(title = "Duration of trains from Geneve to Paris from 2015-18",
       subtitle = "In Minutes",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Average Journey Times (in minutes)") 
anim_save("GeneveDurations.gif")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("GeneveDurations.gif")
```
This graph is interesting, because it shows that the duration of trains going from Geneve to Paris Lyon actually increased between 2015 and 2018. Additionally, we see that the number of trains making this journey seems to decrease in 2018.

## Garden data

  3. In this exercise, you will create a stacked area plot that reveals itself over time (see the `geom_area()` examples [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_stack.html)). You will look at cumulative harvest of tomato varieties over time. You should do the following:
  * From the `garden_harvest` data, filter the data to the tomatoes and find the *daily* harvest in pounds for each variety.  
  * Then, for each variety, find the cumulative harvest in pounds.  
  * Use the data you just made to create a static cumulative harvest area plot, with the areas filled with different colors for each vegetable and arranged (HINT: `fct_reorder()`) from most to least harvested (most on the bottom).  
  * Add animation to reveal the plot over date. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>%
  complete(variety, date = seq.Date(min(date), max(date), by="day")) %>%
  select(-c(vegetable, units)) %>%
  mutate(weight = replace_na(weight, 0)) %>%
  group_by(variety, date) %>%
  summarize(daily_harvest_lb = sum(weight)*0.00220462) %>%
  mutate(cumsum_daily_harvest_lb = cumsum(daily_harvest_lb)) %>%
  select(-daily_harvest_lb) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_area(aes(x = date, y = cumsum_daily_harvest_lb, fill = variety), 
              position = position_stack()) +
    transition_reveal(date) +
    labs(title = "Cumulative Harvest of Tomato Varieties over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Cumulative Daily Harvest (Lb)",
       subtitle = "{frame_along}") 
anim_save("CumHarvest.gif")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("CumHarvest.gif")
```

## Maps, animation, and movement!

  4. Map my `mallorca_bike_day7` bike ride using animation! 
  Requirements:
  * Plot on a map using `ggmap`.  
  * Show "current" location with a red point. 
  * Show path up until the current point.  
  * Color the path according to elevation.  
  * Show the time in the subtitle.  
  * CHALLENGE: use the `ggimage` package and `geom_image` to add a bike image instead of a red point. You can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llendway/animation_and_interactivity/master/bike.png) image. See [here](https://goodekat.github.io/presentations/2019-isugg-gganimate-spooky/slides.html#35) for an example. 
  * Add something of your own! And comment on if you prefer this to the static map and why or why not.
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
bike_image_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llendway/animation_and_interactivity/master/bike.png"

mallorca_bike_day7 <- mallorca_bike_day7 %>%
  mutate(image = bike_image_link)

mallorca_map <- get_stamenmap(
    bbox = c(left = 2.28, bottom = 39.41, right = 3.03, top = 39.8), 
    maptype = "terrain",
    zoom = 11)
ggmap(mallorca_map) +
  geom_point(data = mallorca_bike_day7, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat),
             color = "Blue", size = .5) +
  geom_path(data = mallorca_bike_day7, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = ele),
             size = .5) +
  labs(title = "Mallorca Bike Trail",
       subtitle = "Time: {frame_along}") +
  geom_image(data = mallorca_bike_day7,
            aes(x = lon, y = lat, image = bike_image_link), 
            size = 0.075) +
  transition_reveal(time) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank())
anim_save("MallorcaBike.gif")
```
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("MallorcaBike.gif")
``` 

I definitely prefer the animated version of this graph. The animation is able to capture my attention for longer, and I can also better notice certain details such as the pause about 3/4th of of the way as well as the direction of the journey.
  
  5. In this exercise, you get to meet my sister, Heather! She is a proud Mac grad, currently works as a Data Scientist at 3M where she uses R everyday, and for a few years (while still holding a full-time job) she was a pro triathlete. You are going to map one of her races. The data from each discipline of the Ironman 70.3 Pan Am championships, Panama is in a separate file - `panama_swim`, `panama_bike`, and `panama_run`. Create a similar map to the one you created with my cycling data. You will need to make some small changes: 1. combine the files (HINT: `bind_rows()`, 2. make the leading dot a different color depending on the event (for an extra challenge, make it a different image using `geom_image()!), 3. CHALLENGE (optional): color by speed, which you will need to compute on your own from the data. You can read Heather's race report [here](https://heatherlendway.com/2016/02/10/ironman-70-3-pan-american-championships-panama-race-report/). She is also in the Macalester Athletics [Hall of Fame](https://athletics.macalester.edu/honors/hall-of-fame/heather-lendway/184) and still has records at the pool. 
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
total_trail <- panama_swim %>%
  bind_rows(list(panama_run, panama_bike)) 
  
panama_map <- get_stamenmap(
  bbox = c(left = -79.56, bottom = 8.88, right = -79.41, top = 9.001),
  maptype = "terrain",
  zoom = 13)

ggmap(panama_map) +
  geom_point(data = total_trail, 
             aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = event, shape = event),
             size = 2) +
  geom_path(data = total_trail,
            aes(x = lon, y = lat, color = event),
            alpha = 0.8, size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Ironman 70.3 Pan Am Championship",
       subtitle = "Time: {frame_along}") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "magma") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank()) +
  transition_reveal(time) 
anim_save("PanamaIronman.gif")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("PanamaIronman.gif")
```   
  
## COVID-19 data

  6. In this exercise, you are going to replicate many of the features in [this](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?region=US) visualization by Aitish Bhatia but include all US states. Requirements:
 * Create a new variable that computes the number of new cases in the past week (HINT: use the `lag()` function you've used in a previous set of exercises). Replace missing values with 0's using `replace_na()`.  
  * Filter the data to omit rows where the cumulative case counts are less than 20.  
  * Create a static plot with cumulative cases on the x-axis and new cases in the past 7 days on the x-axis. Connect the points for each state over time. HINTS: use `geom_path()` and add a `group` aesthetic.  Put the x and y axis on the log scale and make the tick labels look nice - `scales::comma` is one option. This plot will look pretty ugly as is.
  * Animate the plot to reveal the pattern by date. Display the date as the subtitle. Add a leading point to each state's line (`geom_point()`) and add the state name as a label (`geom_text()` - you should look at the `check_overlap` argument).  
  * Use the `animate()` function to have 200 frames in your animation and make it 30 seconds long. 
  * Comment on what you observe.
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
covid19 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(lag7 = lag(cases, 7, order_by = date)) %>%
  replace_na(list(lag7 = 0)) %>%
  mutate(new_cases_past_week = cases - lag7) %>%
  filter(cases >= 20) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = cases, y = new_cases_past_week, group = state)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_path(color = "grey") +
  geom_text(aes(label = state), check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Trajectory of US COVID-19 Confirmed Cases",
    x = "Total Confirmed Cases",
    y = "New Confirmed Cases (in the Past Week)",
    subtitle = "Date: {frame_along}") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color="Red"), 
          axis.title.y = element_text(color="Red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  transition_reveal(date) -> covid19_gganim

animate(covid19_gganim,
        nframes = 200,
        duration = 30)
```
  
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
anim_save("covid2.gif")
```

  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("covid2.gif")
```

In this graph, we see how New York is the leading state in terms of speed of emergence and intensity of COVID-19. Almost all the states closely follow to a lower extent after that, and eventually states like Florida and Texas have a higher number of new cases. States like Hawai, Guam, Alaska and the Virgin Islands continue to have a low number of new cases throughout.

  7. In this exercise you will animate a map of the US, showing how cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents has changed over time. This is similar to exercises 11 & 12 from the previous exercises, with the added animation! So, in the end, you should have something like the static map you made there, but animated over all the days. Put date in the subtitle. Comment on what you see.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
covid19_population <-
  covid19 %>% 
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state)) %>%
  left_join(census_pop_est_2018,
            by = "state") %>% 
  group_by(state, est_pop_2018, date) %>%
  summarize(cumulative_cases = max(cases)) %>%
  mutate(cases_per_10000 = (cumulative_cases/est_pop_2018)*10000)

states_map <- map_data("state")

covid_map <- covid19_population %>% 
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state), weekday = wday(date, label=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(weekday == "Fri") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_map(map = states_map,
           aes(map_id = state, fill = cases_per_10000, group = date)) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) + 
  labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people in the United States") +
  theme(legend.background = element_blank()) + 
  theme_map() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  transition_states(date, transition_length = 0) +
  labs(subtitle = "On {next_state}")

animate(covid_map, duration = 30)
anim_save("covid.gif", covid_map)
```
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("covid.gif")
```    

In this visualization, we see a similar trend as decribed in the previous graph. The cumulative COVID-19 cases are initially the highest in east coast states like New York, which is closely followed by inland states. With the exception of a few states towards the end, almost every state is at the yellow-green end of the color spectrum, indicating that there were more than 300 cases per 10,000 people in each of those states.
